# Google-Stock-Prices-2023
## Here is a summary of everything that was done:

* I imported the necessary libraries and loaded the stock price data into a Pandas dataframe.
* I performed data cleaning and feature engineering to prepare the data for analysis.
* I visualized the data using a candlestick chart and a correlation matrix heatmap.
* I performed statistical analysis on the data, including hypothesis testing and regression analysis.
* I built and evaluated several machine learning models, including linear regression, random forest regression, gradient boosting regression, XGBoost regression, Ridge regression, and Lasso regression.
* I selected the best-performing model, gradient boosting regression, and further evaluated its performance on a larger test set, using cross-validation, and tuning its hyperparameters.
* The final model achieved an RMSE of 22.26 on the test set.
* Overall, we were able to analyze the stock price data, build and evaluate several predictive models, and select the best model to make accurate predictions on future stock prices.
